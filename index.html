            <p>
                On a cool October morning, two men crouch down near a chain link fence along Melnea Cass Boulevard and
                make a deal. One
                of the men, younger, perhaps in his late 20s, rolls up the left sleeve of his fleece coat while the
                other thumbs through
                a handful of cash before stuffing it into his jacket pocket. Cars bustle past along the street.

        <div class="intro-col" id="pic1-2">

            <p>About a dozen yards away, Domingos Darosa, a Roxbury native and community activist, walks through the
                grass between the
                sidewalk and the fence, his eyes scanning the ground for hypodermic needles. He’s wearing steel-toed
                boots and white
                latex gloves, and he carries a small red box with a clear plastic lid with an opening to drop the
                needles through. He
                picks up 10 needles in the first minute he’s there.

                The younger man, his head covered by a New England Patriots beanie, gets ready to shoot up nearby, and
                the other stands
                up and looks around. Darosa approaches, following the trail of needles as he picks them up one by one.

                “Be careful, guys,” Darosa says to the men as he picks up a plastic water bottle filled with used
                syringes.
                “There’s a bad batch going around.”

            </p>

        <div class="intro-col" id="pic1-5">
            <p>
                The older man nods and reaches into his pockets. Darosa knows the drill: he walks closer and holds open
                the red box as
                the man drops two needles inside.
            </p>

                This is all routine for Darosa and others in the community trying to keep as many needles off the ground
                as they can.
                They walk through city parks and playgrounds, under overpasses and along sidewalks, picking up what they
                see and
                emptying their full boxes into red kiosks scattered across the area for needles to be safely deposited.

                Darosa said he noticed a problem with discarded needles about eight years ago. Since then, he said, the
                issue has
                skyrocketed.

                311 data from the city of Boston corroborates this, showing that the number of requests for needle
                pick-ups has steadily
                increased over the past five years –– now totalling over 17,000. The needles are but a quantifier of a
                bigger problem, a
                numerable proxy for the larger topic at hand: the nation’s opioid crisis.

                Darosa continues on his way, picking up more needles. Some are hidden beneath leaves that have fallen
                from the tree
                branches overhead. Others have the needle either bent or broken off, a sign of a conscious effort made
                by people
                suffering from drug addiction, Darosa says, to mitigate the spread of disease.

                He also picks up empty Narcan dispensers, the medication used to treat narcotic overdoses.

                “Any time you see these,” Darosa says, “that means someone was brought back to life.”

            <h2>Residents Respond</h2>
            <p>
                Aside from Darosa, other Boston residents have also started taking matters into their own hands. Andrew
                Brand, a computer
                professional and South End resident who lives along Massachusetts Avenue, has started exploring the 311
                data on his own
                in an attempt to make sense of the issue. </br></br>

                Brand said his interest in the needle collection data began as a way for him to practice creating
                graphics and studying
                the opioid crisis. Brand sought hard data, rather than anecdotal evidence, to show that the opioid
                epidemic was
                heightened in Roxbury and the South End.

        <div class='column' id='map-change0'>
            The 311 requests for needle collection show what Brand expected to be true –– that there is a higher
            concentration of
            calls coming from those two neighborhoods than elsewhere.

        <div class='column' id='map-change3'>
            The data itself has its limitations, though, Brand said. </br></br>
            To begin with, the needles are only one quantifiable dimension of the real problem at hand: the opioid
            crisis. Further,
            the data doesn’t show how many used needles are actually on the streets –– it only reflects the calls made
            to request
            their removal.

        </div>
        <div class="divide"></div>
        <div class='column' id='map-change4'>
            “The needles are really one aspect of the problem. They’re the only (quantifiable) aspect of the problem
            that I have
            access to,” Brand said. “Really, I want the neighborhood to be cleaned up and go back to the way it was,
            which was sort
            of a normal neighborhood, albeit one next to the hospitals. It always had its share of homeless people, but
            they didn’t
            really cause any quality of life problems for the neighborhood.”

            Brand isn’t the only Boston resident who’s had enough. </br></br>

            Jennifer, another South End resident, had her first close call with used needles in the spring of
            2018. While
            playing with her son in Southwest Corridor Park, she noticed him bending towards something. As he went to
            grab it, she
            recognized the tell-tale clear syringe and pulled him away before he could pick up the used needle.

            <p>
                Though that was the only needle her now 3-year-old has nearly gotten ahold of, Jennifer said she sees
                discarded syringes
                around Boston, and in parks and playgrounds, on a weekly basis.

        <div class="divide"></div>
        <div class="intro-col" id="pic2-2">

            <p>The problem has become so severe that she now chooses to keep her son in indoor play areas, or takes him
                to museums or
                suburban parks. She has even started exploring possible solutions for the community at large to deal
                with discarded
                needles and the effects of the opioid crisis.

                “I’m just a mom. I’m not an opioid expert, but clearly, the city is looking for solutions,” Jennifer said.
                “No one knows
                what to do, so I do have a list of things.”</br></br>

                Among her ideas for possible solutions are distributing retractable needles rather than standard
                syringes, and making
                them brightly colored so pedestrians can easily spot them and dispose of them.</br></br>

                After the incident with her son, Jennifer called the Boston Public Health Commission’s needle exchange, and
                was unsettled
                to find that they are not exchanging needles, but rather, distributing them without requiring an
                exchange. As long as
                they are giving out syringes, she said, they might as well be making them easier for the general public
                to identify and
                discard.</br></br>

                As a first-time parent, Jennifer said she worries during the day that her son will be stuck by a needle
                while playing. At
                night, she worries that her husband, a surgeon at Boston Medical Center on Massachusetts Avenue –– part
                of an area
                otherwise known as the Methadone Mile –– isn’t safe when he leaves work.</br></br>

                To Jennifer's family, the side effects of the opioid crisis have become too much to sustain. They are
                now actively
                seeking to relocate outside of Boston.</br></br>

                “The city is being taken over,” Jennifer said. “If you were to have asked me four years ago if I wanted to
                raise my son in
                the city, I would say 100%. I love the city, I’m an extroverted person, I enjoy community, but now we’re
                actively
                looking to get out of the city for the sole reason of the drug-using community … It’s just too much at
                this point.”

                was closed and torn down due to safety
                concerns. For
                years, the campus was a place where people struggling with addiction could go for shelter and recovery

                In the years since that access was cut off, community members in Roxbury and the South End have noticed
                a growing

                One of BPHC’s main priorities is mitigating the spread of disease that can occur when people share and
                reuse needles. To
                combat this issue, the department gives out clean needles, as well as other items such as sterile wipes,
                toothpaste,
                soap and feminine hygiene products. While the program is called a needle exchange, people can still get
                clean needles
                without turning in used ones.

                Some have criticized this strategy, arguing that the program is only putting more needles out into the
                community. But
                Chaparo says the department collects more syringes –– whether they are turned in or picked up off the
                ground –– than it
                hands out. He estimated that his team collects some 200 to 250 needles every day.</br></br>

                “I would give out as many needles as someone needs for them to not get a disease,” he said. “Anywhere
                that someone is
                dropping a needle, of course (we’re concerned) if someone gets stuck. But when we think about the bigger
                picture –– you
                know, I just heard on the news about a new strain of HIV. There’s new strains of Hepatitis C, there’s
                all these new
                things that have come in. I’d rather keep giving out needles to lessen that harm.”</p>

                Chaparo said his department also distributes small containers for people to place their used syringes
                in,
                like the red
                box Domingos carries with him when he’s collecting needles off the ground. When the box fills up, it is
                turned in to the
                department in exchange for more clean needles

                Another strategy has been the placement of large red kiosks around the city for depositing needles
                safely.</br></br>
                This move has
                also drawn criticism, particularly with two kiosks placed near the Orchard Gardens K-8 School, which
                sits a
                short walk
                from the intersection of Melnea Cass Boulevard and Massachusetts Avenue, part of the area known as
                Methadone
                Mile.

                Jennifer, for one, said the kiosks aren’t the answer –– especially not when placed in front of
                schools.</br></br>

                “Putting something like that next to a school, that’s not the solution,” Jennifer said. “It’s like saying a
                person who’s
                drunk is going to pick up all their stuff. They’re just not in the frame of mind.”

            <h2>‘We’ve always been here’</h2>
            <p>

                The Orchard Gardens School has been dealing with the issue of littered needles for at least the past
                four
                years. In
                2015, school nurse Sue Burchill designed a brochure to hand out to students in the K-8 school explaining
                what to do when
                they see a needle on the ground.</br></br>

                “You learn to stop, drop and roll in school when there’s a fire,” she said in a recent interview. “Our
                brochure says ‘If
                you see a needle, stop, turn and tell an adult. If there’s no adults, call 311.’”</br></br>

                The key point is for children to not pick up the needle themselves, but Burchill said she believes the
                kiosks encourage
                students to do precisely that.</br></br>

                The brochure is written in three languages. The school has nearly 1,000 children, she said, and about
                75%
                are learning
                English as a second language.</br></br></p>

            <p> “We started the brochure and have been educating the students since 2015,” said Burchill, a lifelong
                Boston resident.
                “It’s 2019. We’ve gone to the mayor, we’ve gone to representatives in the neighborhood, we’ve

                    stood
                    outside on the
                    sidewalk</a> on Melnea Cass and Albany (Street) with signs. Nobody seemed to care until the South
                End community, the wealthy
                physicians and such, as needles started coming their way, that’s when they started paying attention.
                That was in 2017.”</br></br>

                “We don’t really have a voice,” she later added. “We are here, and we’ve always been here.”

                311 data shows a high concentration of calls for needle pickups coming from the area surrounding the
                school. Custodians walk the school
                grounds
                each morning
                checking for needles and other drug-related litter before students arrive, Burchill said.

                One day last fall, she said several hundred pill capsules were discovered on the kindergarten
                playground. In
                November
                2018,

                    boy was pricked by a needle</a> during recess. Burchill said he had to undergo testing to rule out
                any
                infections
                and is okay.

                A short time later, a class of students was asked how the school could be made safer. The students
                responded in words
                and pictures. One student drew a picture of a boy in a yellow shirt and blue pants laying in a pile of
                leaves with
                several needles stuck to his body.</br></br>

                The student wrote, “I would like people to come early in the morning to pick up all the needles so the
                students will be
                safe especially now because the leaves are falling off the trees and we can’t see the
                needles.”</br></br>

                “It’s adorable,” Burchill said. “Well, it’s not adorable. It’s sickening.”</br></br></p>
